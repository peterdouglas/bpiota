bpIOTA
=====

Modified version of gIOTA to add Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Bulletproofs.

Research code and cannot be used with the IOTA reference implementation (IRI) due to changes.

This library is still in flux and there maybe breaking changes.

Consider to use a dependency tool to use vendoring,
e.g. [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep), [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) or [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).
